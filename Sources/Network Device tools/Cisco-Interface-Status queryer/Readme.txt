 Since we have some Cisco-ISR devices with some interfaces each,
 and the interfaces are named according to the devices connected to them,
 this script gathers the names of all Interfaces on all ISRs, through the command "Show interfaces Status", into a text file as an output on the local Desktop.
 Notes:
    - to run this script on a system, the Plink doesn't need to be installed before!
